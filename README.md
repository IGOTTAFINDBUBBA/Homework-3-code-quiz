Third homework assignment coding quiz

Incomplete. 

this wasnt how i wanted to send this homework in, but i got stuck and was overdue with other assignments. im hoping to get back to this because i had a few ideas i wanted to use. 

The javascript doesnt work for neither the clock or the questions, but what i had planned for this was creating several hidden forms whithin the html and a previous and next buttons so when you completed the first set of questions and hit next the next set of questions would appear. i wanted the clock to start when you hit the start button and stop when you answered you last question.
